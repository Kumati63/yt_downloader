# YTDownloader

YTDownloader is a responsive web application built with Django that allows users to download YouTube videos easily. The page provides an intuitive interface for searching videos and downloading them in various formats.

# Problems

Although it is working, it can only download the video without audio. I couldn't get it to download the video with the audio embedded together, nor could I download the audio separately.
